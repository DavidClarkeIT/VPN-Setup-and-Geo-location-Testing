<h1 align="center">VPN Setup and Geo-Location Testing</h1>

In this lab, you will set up a virtual machine in Azure, test internet geolocation from different regions, and configure a VPN to explore how it affects online location and browsing experiences. You will also learn to manage Azure resources and observe the impact of VPN connections on websites and services.

<h1 align="center">Lab Overiew</h1>

*Image Above Explained*

1. Visit https:whatismyipaddress.com from your personal computer
2. Create a VM and connect via RDP
3. Access https:whatismyipaddress.com from the VM
4. Install and connect to a VPN on the VM
5. Revisit https:whatismyipaddress.com from the VPN

<h1 align="center">What is a VPN?</h1>

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a secure connection that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another location, masking your IP address and making your online activities more private.  

**Example:** If you're in the U.S. and connect to a VPN server in Japan, websites will see your location as Japan, allowing access to region-specific content while keeping your data secure.

**VPN Metaphor Example:** A VPN is like a secure tunnel for your internet traffic. Imagine sending a letter through a courier that hides the sender’s address and replaces it with their own. The recipient sees the courier's address, not yours, keeping your identity private and secure.

## Configuration Steps

<details>

<summary>

### 🌐 Step 1: Browse https:whatismyipaddress.com from your Personal Computer

</summary>

Before creating our resources we'll **browse to https:whatismyipaddress.com** from our **personal computer** and take note of this in a text file.

*This is number 1 from the lab overview image explanation.*

</details>

<details>

<summary>

### 🌐 Step 2: Browse https:whatismyipaddress.com from your Virtual Machine

</summary>

Create your resource group and virtual machine then login. **Pick a different region** from your own.

<img width="800" alt="isolated" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5fd3801-609c-45ce-bd2f-d844a62323ea">

<br>
<br>
<br>

Once inside the VM open Microsoft Edge and **browose https:whatismyipaddress.com** then **take note** of it in a text file.

*This is number 3 from the lab overview image explanation.*

### 🌐 Step 3: Sign Up for ProtonVPN and Test the VPN Connection on the VM

</summary>

Once you create an account login on your VM and go to **Downloads**, select **Windows**, then on the next page select **Windows 11/10**.

<img width="800" alt="isolated" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f4f9931-726d-43fb-afd8-2c620c0d1e28">

<br>
<br>
<br>

Open the **ProtonVPN download**, click **OK**, click **Next**, click **Install**, then **login**.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Once you get logged in select **Quick Connect** in the upper left corner and ProtonVPN will assign your VM a VPN server in a new region.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

### 🌐 Step 4: Revisit https:whatismyipaddress.com from the VPN

</summary>

Now that you have a VPN linked to your VM you can **Revisit https:whatismyipaddress.com** and **take note** of the new information in a text file.

Observe in the text file how each piece of information is different, highlighting the difference between using a VPN and not using one. A **VPN will help mask your true IP address** and **encrypt your internet traffic**, making it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activity, access your personal or business information and resources, or even launch targeted attacks based on your location.

*This is number 5 from the lab overview image explanation.*

</details>

<details>

<summary>

### 🌐 Step 5: Explore Websites using a VPN on the VM

</summary>

**Visit Google** and **perform a search**. Observe how the search results populate, as the language and content may reflect the region of your current IP address or VPN connection.

<img width="800" alt="isolated" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0efc13bd-3639-486d-80c1-f9ef5369cbeb">

<br>
<br>
<br>

Change your server and we'll try another website next. Select **Change Server** in the upper left corner.

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Browse samsung.com, apple.com, or youtube.com** and notice the region your VPN is in will be displayed as the location on the website.

<summary>

### 🌐 Step 5: Clean Up Azure Resources

</summary>

Go back into your Azure portal and **delete all your resources** when your done.

<h2 align="center">Final Thoughts</h2>

This lab demonstrated how VPNs can enhance online privacy, mask your location, and provide access to region-specific content. By setting up a virtual machine in Azure and testing a VPN, we explored the practical impacts of geolocation changes and gained hands-on experience with cloud resources and VPN configuration. These skills are essential for understanding network security, privacy, and global connectivity in today’s digital world.
